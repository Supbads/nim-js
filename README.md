This is a javascript implementation of the mathematical strategy game [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), where you play against the computer. The styling was influenced by Nrich's resource [Drips](https://nrich.maths.org/11818).

The game board consists of counters arranged into columns. You take it in turns with the computer to remove as many counters as you like from a single column. The aim of the game is to remove the last counter.
